### How to install _socialAD_

You can install this open source package by downloading it from pip:

```pip install socialAD```

To get started, in your Python work environment, do:

```import socialAD```

To use our various modules, use the following statements:

```
import socialAD.forward as fw
import socialAD.forward_pro as fwp
import socialAD.root_finding as rf
import socialAD.gradient as gd
import numpy as np
```

For details, please check out our [documentation](https://github.com/climate-change-is-real-python-dev/cs107-FinalProject/blob/master/docs/documentation.ipynb).


### Broader Impact Statement

There are multiple ways to use our package for greater scientific and social good. There are also ways to misuse our package in these respects.

The functions we provide are widely applicable in many fields. For example, engineers use root-finding to optimize space given material constraints, data scientists use root-finding to inform machine learning models, physicists find stationary points to map particle motion, and economists find stationary points to describe changing markets. To the extent that fields may use our package to spur innovation, solve problems that help humanity, create a more efficient workforce and economy, and work towards a more advanced and just world - we will be proud our package made some contribution to these efforts.

However, alongside innovation can come consequences. For example, our gradient descement implementations may be used in machine learning implementations. Machine learning algorithms have introduced bias in [policing and in court systems](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing), taken [jobs away](https://time.com/5876604/machines-jobs-coronavirus/) from the service industry (and others), and accelerated new ways of [illegal hacking](https://techhq.com/2020/09/how-hackers-are-weaponizing-artificial-intelligence/). In addition, fields of science that could utilize our package and that spur technological innovation (such as physics) can also spur great human loss with that innovation (such as the invention of the atomic bomb - as one historic example). We strongly encourage those who use our package to consider the consequences of their work, especially as they apply their work to contexts that are prone to the types of issues mentioned above. 


### Software Inclusivity

Our package is open-source on GitHub, and pull requests can be made by anyone who has a free GitHub account. The package authors (Tao, Jenny, Ju, and Dash) will approve pull requests after collectively discussing the impact of those pull requests. We will review pull requests without viewing the personal details of user accounts who make them, thus preventing some level of bias in our decisions.

However, there may be underlying barriers that prevent certain populations from easily contributing to our work.

For example, our core coding group primarily speaks English. Those who speak primarily other languages may have a difficult time submitting requests and interpreting/responding to feedback comments. To handle this issue, we will use google translate and other newly developed translation tools to provide feedback in the same language as is presented to us during the feedback process. While these translations are not perfect, they will be better than no translation. We will consult language experts for translation help when applicable.

In addition, a general digital divide in access to technology and access to the education that would allow for skill in tools to contribute will prevent some from contributing to our package. The authors of this package commit to contributing to nonprofits that help break down this digital and educational divide. Specifically, we will make contributions to [Partners Bridging the Digital Divide](https://www.pbdd.org/) on an annual basis.
